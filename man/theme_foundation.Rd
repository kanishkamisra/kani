\details{
This theme is designed to be a foundation from which to build new
themes, and not meant to be used directly. \code{theme_foundation}
is a complete theme with only minimal number of elements defined.
It is easier to create new themes by extending this one rather
than \code{theme_gray} or \code{theme_bw}, because those themes
those themes define elements deep in the hierarchy.

This theme takes \code{theme_gray} and sets all \code{colour} and \code{fill}
values to \code{NULL}, except for the top-level elements
(\code{line}, \code{rect}, and \code{title}), which have \code{colour = "black"},
and \code{fill = "white"}. This leaves the spacing
and-non colour defaults of the default \code{ggplot2} themes in place.
